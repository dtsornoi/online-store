      <p class="text-center">Welcome to Online Store, your number one source for all things.
        We're dedicated to giving you the very best of our products,
        with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.
        Founded in 2021 by Mark, Dmitri and Vladimir, Online Store has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office, Estonia.
        When store founders first started out, their passion for
        helping people and programming drove them to do intense research,
        and gave them the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store.
        We now serve customers all over Estonia, and are thrilled to be a part of its community.

        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you.
        If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
